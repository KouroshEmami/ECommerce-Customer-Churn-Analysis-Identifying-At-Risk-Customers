# E-Commerce Customer Churn Analysis

## Objective
Analyze customer purchasing behavior to identify patterns leading to churn, defined as customers who haven't made a purchase in the last 365 days. Provide actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies.

## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL: Data extraction and transformation from a simulated data warehouse.
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn): Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive analysis with narrative storytelling.
- Data Storytelling: Presenting findings in a business context.
- Correlation & Group-Based Analysis: Identifying key factors associated with customer churn.
